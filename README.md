# Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++! This is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, usually 'X' and 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## How to Play

3. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:
4. Run the compiled executable:



5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Players will take turns entering row and column numbers to place their marks.

## Features

- Classic 3x3 grid for playing Tic Tac Toe.
- Two-player gameplay mode.
- Input validation to ensure valid moves.
- Clear instructions and prompts for a user-friendly experience.

## Future Improvements

This project is a basic implementation of Tic Tac Toe in C++, and there's always room for enhancement. Some potential improvements for the future include:

- Implementing an AI opponent with varying levels of difficulty.
- Adding a graphical interface using a library like SFML or Qt.
- Keeping track of game statistics such as wins, losses, and ties.
- Allowing players to customize their symbols or grid size.

Feel free to contribute to these improvements or come up with your own creative ideas!
